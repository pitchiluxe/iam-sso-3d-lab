/**
 * vm/adlab/validation.ts — the examiner.
 *
 * Deterministic checks over the lab state. This, and only this, decides
 * whether a lab is technically correct. The instructor is handed the results
 * and turns them into coaching; it is never asked "is this right?", so a small
 * local model cannot hallucinate a pass or a failure.
 *
 * Each check also carries its three-rung hint ladder:
 *   1. direction      — where to look, no commands, no answers
 *   2. investigation  — which diagnostic tool to run and what field to read
 *   3. concept        — the principle to compare against
 * None of the rungs is the fix. The student still types it.
