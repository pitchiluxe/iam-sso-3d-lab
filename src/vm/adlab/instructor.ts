/**
 * vm/adlab/instructor.ts — the Ollama instructor for the AD Enterprise Lab
 * Series.
 *
 *   The validation engine is the examiner. The student is the administrator.
 *   This is the instructor.
 *
 * It observes (a frozen snapshot from observe.ts), teaches, asks, hints and
 * explains. It cannot act: this module imports nothing that changes lab state
 * — not the command engine, not the lab builder — and tests/adLab.test.ts
 * holds it to that. Whatever the model writes is text for the student to read.
 *
 * It never decides correctness either. "Check my work" runs the validation
 * engine first and hands the instructor the results; the prompt forbids it
 * from contradicting them, and the window only ever shows a lab as complete
 * when the engine says so.
 *
 * Without Ollama there is still an instructor: the offline one below builds
 * its replies from the lab definition, the validation results, the hint ladder
 * and the evidence notes. Narrower than the model, never wrong.
