/**
 * config/vmHost.ts — identity of the simulated workstation the VM represents.
 *
 * One definition, because the Settings app and the terminal both describe this
 * machine and had drifted: Settings called it APEX-OPS-01 running "Apex OS 11",
 * while `hostname` and `systeminfo` reported NW-IT-WS01 running Windows 11.
 * A learner checking the same fact two ways got two answers.
 *
 * These are deliberately fictional and describe the *simulated* host, never the
 * real machine the app runs on — reporting the learner's actual hostname, IP or
 * MAC would be both wrong for a lab and a privacy problem.
